# Application Summary

## Architecture
This document provides a summary of the application's architecture, key modules, and their relationships.

## Key Modules
- Placeholder for module descriptions.
- Include information about the functionality, dependencies, and interaction with other modules.

## Key Files by Size
- See codebase_stats.txt for a complete listing of files by line count
- The largest files often represent core functionality or areas that might need refactoring

## High-Level Next Steps for LLM
1. Identify and generate module summaries for frontend, backend, and database.
2. Document core workflows and user journeys within the application.
3. Use the LLM relationship prompt (llm_relationship_prompt.txt) to generate a comprehensive relationship analysis.
4. Pay special attention to the largest files and their relationships to other components.
