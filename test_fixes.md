# MCP Codebase Insight Test Fixes

## Identified Issues

1. **Package Import Problems**
   - The tests were trying to import from `mcp_codebase_insight` directly, but the package needed to be imported from `src.mcp_codebase_insight`
   - The Python path wasn't correctly set up to include the project root directory

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - The `sentence-transformers` package was installed in the wrong Python environment (Python 3.13 instead of 3.11)
   - Had to explicitly install it in the correct environment

3. **Test Isolation Problems**
   - Tests were failing due to not being properly isolated
   - The `component_test_runner.py` script needed fixes to properly load test modules

4. **Qdrant Server Issue**
   - The `test_vector_store_cleanup` test failed due to permission issues in the Qdrant server
   - The server couldn't create a collection directory for the test

## Applied Fixes

1. **Fixed Import Paths**
   - Modified test files to use `from src.mcp_codebase_insight...` instead of `from mcp_codebase_insight...`
   - Added code to explicitly set `sys.path` to include the project root directory

2. **Fixed Dependency Issues**
   - Ran `python3.11 -m pip install sentence-transformers` to install the package in the correct environment
   - Verified all dependencies were properly installed

3. **Created a Test Runner Script**
   - Created `run_test_with_path_fix.sh` to set up the proper environment variables and paths
   - Modified `component_test_runner.py` to better handle module loading

4. **Fixed Test Module Loading**
   - Added a `load_test_module` function to properly handle import paths
   - Ensured the correct Python path is set before importing test modules

## Results

- Successfully ran 2 out of 3 vector store tests:
  - ✅ `test_vector_store_initialization`
  - ✅ `test_vector_store_add_and_search`
  - ❌ `test_vector_store_cleanup` (still failing due to Qdrant server issue)

## Recommendations for Remaining Issue

The `test_vector_store_cleanup` test is failing due to the Qdrant server not being able to create a directory for the collection. This could be fixed by:

1. Checking the Qdrant server configuration to ensure it has proper permissions to create directories
2. Creating the necessary directories beforehand
3. Modifying the test to use a collection name that already exists or mock the collection creation

The error message suggests a file system permission issue:
```
"Can't create directory for collection cleanup_test_db679546. Error: No such file or directory (os error 2)"
```

A simpler fix for testing purposes might be to modify the Qdrant Docker run command to include a volume mount with proper permissions:

```bash
docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 -v $(pwd)/qdrant_data:/qdrant/storage qdrant/qdrant
```

This would ensure the storage directory exists and has the right permissions.
