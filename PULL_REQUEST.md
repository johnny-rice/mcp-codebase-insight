# GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements

@coderabbit I'd like to request your detailed review of our GitHub Actions workflows.

## Overview

This PR aims to improve the GitHub Actions workflows in our repository by:

1. **Documenting** all existing workflows
2. **Addressing** the test pattern issue in build-verification.yml
3. **Extracting** common functionality into reusable scripts
4. **Standardizing** practices across different workflows

## Changes

- Added comprehensive documentation of all GitHub Actions workflows
- Fixed the wildcard pattern issue (`test_*`) in build-verification.yml
- Extracted Qdrant health check logic into a reusable script
- Added README for the scripts directory

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Common logic is now in a single location
- **Readability**: Workflows are cleaner and better documented
- **Reliability**: Fixed test pattern ensures more consistent test execution
- **Extensibility**: Easier to add new workflows or modify existing ones

## Request for Review

@coderabbit, I'm particularly interested in your feedback on:

1. The overall structure and organization of the workflows
2. Any redundancies or inefficiencies you notice
3. Best practices we might be missing
4. Suggestions for further improvements

## Future Improvements

We're planning to implement more improvements based on your feedback:

- Extract more common functionality into reusable actions
- Standardize environment variables across workflows
- Improve caching strategies
- Add workflow dependencies to avoid redundant work

Thank you for your time and expertise!
